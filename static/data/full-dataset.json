    "description": "It’s finally here: get ready for the 2017 UBC Social Enterprise Conference! \n\nThis year, we bring you “Accelerating Impact: Scaling Solutions to Social Challenges.” \n\nWe believe that social entrepreneurs will inevitably face a critical juncture that the existing solutions are futile in making a wider impact in society. Therefore, the question we need to ask ourselves is “How can social entrepreneurs effectively scale their impact to reach as many people and communities?” \n\nThrough the experience of the conference and the presence of multiple inspiring and thought-provoking social entrepreneurs, you will walk away with two major lessons. First is that scale is not solely determined by organization’s size or budget, but by the change it helps to usher in. Second, collective impact is crucial in the process of creating change.\n\nDelegates will range from students who are new to the idea of social enterprise to those who are deeply engaged in the field. They will hear from thought leaders who have created immense scalable change within their respective fields as well as fellow students who have started their own social ventures. Taking it one step further, delegates will also be challenged to think critically about how they can innovatively affect change and present their ideas under the mentorship of successful social entrepreneurs. \n\nDresscode is smart casual! \n\nTICKETS ARE NOW FOR SALE! \nGet them at http://ow.ly/NwNC308yLPe \n\nAll faculties are welcomed!! \n\nEarly birds: Sold out \nUBC Students: $25 \nMembers: $20 \nNon-UBC Students: $40 \n\nSAVE THE DATE: Join us on MARCH 4th at The Nest for a day of impactful discussions, engaging panels, and insights on the possibilities of making impact at scale. \n\nCheck out our website for more details: http://ubcsocialenterpriseconference.com/",
